# OARepoDecisions
This GitHub repo/project is to capturing the discussion and decisions related to architectual design decisions necessary to implment the OA Repo.

You can find open Issues that need discussion in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/UW-Libraries/OARepoDecisions/issues) at the top of this page. We will try to manually track the state of a given Issue on the OA Repo Decisions [Project Board](https://github.com/UW-Libraries/OARepoDecisions/projects/1).

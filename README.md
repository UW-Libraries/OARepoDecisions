# OA Repo Architectual Design Decisions
This GitHub repo/project is to capturing the discussion and decisions related to architectual design decisions necessary to implement the OA Repo.

You can find open _Issues that need discussion_ in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/UW-Libraries/OARepoDecisions/issues) at the top of this page. We will try to manually track the state of a given Issue on the OA Repo Decisions [Project Board](https://github.com/UW-Libraries/OARepoDecisions/projects/1).
